                <h3>The Importance of Food Donation</h3>
                <p>Did you know that approximately one-third of the food produced globally goes to waste? This staggering statistic highlights the importance of food donation as a means to combat hunger and reduce waste. By connecting surplus food with those in need, we can create a more sustainable and equitable food system.</p>

                <h3>How to Start Your Own Food Donation Drive</h3>
                <p>Starting your own food donation drive is easier than you think! Begin by identifying a local partner, such as a food bank or shelter, that can help distribute the food. Next, set a date and location for your drive, and promote it through social media and community boards. Remember, every contribution, no matter how small, makes a difference.</p>

                <h3>The Role of Agriculture in Food Security</h3>
                <p>Sustainable agriculture is vital for ensuring food security in our communities. By supporting local farmers through initiatives like farmer's markets and community-supported agriculture (CSA), we can promote healthy eating while also reducing our carbon footprint. Every purchase helps strengthen the local economy and ensures fresh, nutritious food is available for everyone.</p>

    <section class="footer">
        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Seed2Feed, an initiative dedicated to reducing food waste and fighting hunger. We collect leftover food from events, hotels, and restaurants and redistribute it to those in need through partnerships with NGOs and school feeding programs.<br>

            Our mission is simple: ensure that no food goes to waste while helping people in need access nutritious meals. We focus on three key areas:
            
            Redistributing Surplus Food: Collecting and delivering excess food to communities.<br>
            School Feeding Programs: Providing meals to underprivileged students to support their education.<br>
            Sustainability & Education: Teaching communities to grow their own food and reduce waste.<br>
            Join us in making a difference—one plate at a time.</p>
